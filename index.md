## My repos
- TrojanZoo [[GitHub](https://github.com/ain-soph/trojanzoo)] [[Docs](https://ain-soph.github.io/trojanzoo)]
  > TrojanZoo provides a universal pytorch platform to conduct security researches (especially backdoor attacks/defenses) of image classification in deep learning. All my research studies are using this powerful library. Docs and unit-tests are still in development.
  
  Published on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/trojanzoo/), [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/local0state/trojanzoo) and [github packages](https://github.com/ain-soph/trojanzoo/pkgs/container/trojanzoo).

- AlpsPlot [[GitHub](https://github.com/ain-soph/alpsplot)] [[Docs](https://ain-soph.github.io/alpsplot)]
  > My personal python plotting library of alps-lab style using matplotlib.

  Published on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/alpsplot/), [docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/local0state/alpsplot) and [github packages](https://github.com/ain-soph/alpsplot/pkgs/container/alpsplot).

- trojanzoo_sphinx_theme [[GitHub](https://github.com/ain-soph/trojanzoo_sphinx_theme)] [[Demo](https://ain-soph.github.io/trojanzoo_sphinx_theme)]
  > I modify [pytorch_sphinx_theme](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch_sphinx_theme), remove auxiliary items and make it a generalized theme. It supports easy customization in your project without touching the package contents.
  
  Published on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/trojanzoo-sphinx-theme/).

- base [[GitHub](https://github.com/ain-soph/base)]
  > My personal automatic workflow to update docker environment of deep learning.
