## [TrojanZoo](https://github.com/ain-soph/trojanzoo)
TrojanZoo provides a universal pytorch platform to conduct security researches (especially backdoor attacks/defenses) of image classification in deep learning. All my research studies are using this powerful library. Docs and unit-tests are still in development.

## [trojanzoo-sphinx-theme](https://github.com/ain-soph/trojanzoo-sphinx-theme)
I modify pytorch-sphinx-theme, remove auxiliary items and make it a generalized theme. It supports easy customization in your project without touching the package contents.
