\section{A. Research Interests}
\vspace{8pt} % provide vertical space between section title and contents
My current research focuses on understanding and tackling the security and privacy challenges arising in the advances of deep learning and artificial intelligence in general.
%including adversarial robustness and neural backdoors. Besides, I'm also interested in exploring security issues in other learning tasks, such as neural architecture search (NAS) and lifelong learning.

\section{D. Research Projects}
\vspace{24pt}

\begin{enumerate}[labelsep=18pt, parsep=8pt]

\item {\em Bridging Auto-Augment and Neural-Architecture-Search}\\
This ongoing project aims to bridge Auto-Augment and NAS, two major AutoML tasks, and also explore the potential security risks in their integration.

\item {\em Encapsulating Attack Robustness}\\
This ongoing project aims to achieve efficient and robust learning via synthesizing compressed versions of given datasets, on which the training bestows models with both accuracy and robustness.  

\item {\em Evaluating Neural Backdoors}\\
This project builds a universal platform (TrojanZoo) that incorporate the state-of-the-art work on neural backdoors, conducts a comprehensive evaluation of existing attacks and models, and exposes the intricate design spectrum for both attackers and defenders. The findings are published in IEEE EuroS\&P'22.

\item {\em Understanding the Security Risks of AutoML}\\
This project reveals that Neural-Architecture-Search (NAS) introduces new security risks: compared with manually-designed models, NAS-generated models tend to suffer greater vulnerabilities to a variety of malicious attacks. The findings are published in USENIX Security'22. 

\item {\em Inferring the Adversary's Intent in Black-box Adversarial Attacks}\\
This project develops a novel estimation model to infer the adversary's intent (e.g., the target class desired by the adversary) during the early stages of black-box adversarial attacks. The findings are published in ACM KDD'20. 

\item {\em Unifying Adversarial Inputs and Trojan Models}\\
%\vspace{2pt}
This project unifies two major attack vectors, adversarial inputs and trojan models, and reveals the intriguing ``mutual reinforcement'' effects: by leveraging one attack vector, the adversary is able to disproportionally amplify the effectiveness of the other. The findings are published in ACM CCS'20.
