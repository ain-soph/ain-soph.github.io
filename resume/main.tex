\section{A. Research Interests}
\vspace{8pt} % provide vertical space between section title and contents
My current research focuses on the security of deep learning, including adversarial robustness and neural backdoors. Besides, I'm also interested in exploring security issues in other learning tasks, such as neural architecture search (NAS) and lifelong learning.

\section{D. Research Projects}
\vspace{24pt}

\begin{enumerate}[labelsep=15pt, parsep=8pt]

\item Auto-Augment and Neural-Architecture-Search(NAS)\\
The work aims to build a bridge between Auto-Augment and NAS, which are the 2 main categories in AutoML. We are also interested in the possible security concerns under this new scenario.

\item Vulnerabilities and Robustness in AutoML\\
We propose that Neural-Architecture-Search(NAS) algorithms introduce vulnerabilities of different kinds of attacks. Compared with human-designed models, the DARTS-like models tend to be more sensitive against PGD, TrojanNN, Membership Inference, etc.

\item Vulnerabilities and Robustness in Dataset Condensation\\
The project evaluates security concerns during dataset condensation and tries to develop a new attack approach to embed backdoors in the condensed data. 

\item Backdoors in Neural Networks\\
We construct a universal platform (TrojanZoo) that contains state-of-the-art works on backdoor attacks and defenses, evaluate the performance of different methods under the same metrics, and explore the underlying mechanism of backdoors in neural networks.

\item Detection of Black-box Adversarial Attacks\\
The project develops a novel estimation model to infer the adversary intent of black-box adversarial attacks.

\item Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Neural Networks\\
My work explores the mutual reinforcement effects between two attack vectors in deep learning: adversarial inputs and poisoned models, and designs a unified framework to control the trade-offs. The framework can be easily extended to the backdoor scenario and lead to a new powerful attack (IMC).

AlpsPlot \\
\url{https://github.com/ain-soph/alpsplot} \\
My personal python plotting library of alps-lab style using matplotlib.

TrojanZoo: Towards Unified, Holistic, and Practical Evaluation of Neural Backdoors \\
\url{https://github.com/ain-soph/trojanzoo} \\
TrojanZoo provides a universal pytorch platform to conduct security researches (especially backdoor attacks/defenses) of image classification in deep learning. All my research studies are using this powerful library. Docs and unit-tests are still in development.

TrojanZoo Sphinx Theme \\
\url{https://github.com/ain-soph/trojanzoo_sphinx_theme} \\
I modify pytorch\_sphinx\_theme, remove auxiliary items and make it a generalized theme. It supports easy customization in your project without touching the package contents.
